# Google Custom Search API - Cost & Setup Explained

## 🆓 Cost: FREE for Most Users!

### Free Tier Details:
- ✅ **100 free searches per day** 
- ✅ **No credit card required**
- ✅ **No monthly charges** if you stay under 100 searches/day
- ✅ Perfect for dealerships adding ~3 vehicles per day or less

### When You'd Pay:
- **After 100 searches/day**: $5 per 1,000 additional searches
- **Example scenarios:**
  - Adding 50 vehicles/month = **FREE**
  - Adding 100 vehicles/month = **FREE** 
  - Adding 500 vehicles/month = **FREE** (about 17 per day)
  - Adding 1,000 vehicles/month = **~$5/month**

### Real-World Math:
- Each time you add a vehicle = 1 search
- 30 days × 100 searches/day = 3,000 searches/month
- First 100 searches/day = FREE
- If you do more: $5 per 1,000 additional searches

## 🚨 Important: You DON'T Need It Right Now!

**Good News:** The system works perfectly WITHOUT Google API:
- ✅ Uses built-in database of vehicle specs
- ✅ Auto-populates Engine, MPG, Transmission, Drivetrain
- ✅ Based on make/model combinations
- ✅ **100% FREE** - no setup required
- ✅ Already working in your system!

**When to add Google API:**
- If you want even more accurate, live data from the web
- If you're adding 100+ vehicles per day
- If you want real-time spec updates

## 📍 Where to Set It Up (If You Want)

### NOT in Google AI Studio ❌
- Google AI Studio is for AI models (Gemini, etc.)
- This is different from Custom Search API

### In Google Cloud Console ✅
- Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/
- This is Google's cloud infrastructure platform
- Different from AI Studio

## 🔧 Setup (Optional - Only If You Want Live Search)

### Quick Setup Steps:
1. **Google Cloud Console** → Create project
2. **APIs & Services** → Enable "Custom Search API"
3. **Credentials** → Create API Key
4. **Google Custom Search** → Create search engine (enable "Search entire web")
5. Add 2 environment variables to `.env.local`

### Time Required:
- **5-10 minutes** total setup time
- One-time setup
- Then it works automatically

## 💡 Recommendation

**For now:** 
- ✅ **Keep using the FREE fallback system** (already working)
- ✅ It auto-populates fields based on make/model
- ✅ No setup needed, no cost

**Later (if needed):**
- Add Google API when you want live web search
- Or if you're adding 100+ vehicles per day
- Easy to add anytime

## Current Status

Your system is already working with:
- ✅ Model-specific trim options (no Z71 for Cruze!)
- ✅ Model-specific engine options
- ✅ Auto-population from built-in database
- ✅ FREE fallback system

Google API would just make it even better with live web search!
