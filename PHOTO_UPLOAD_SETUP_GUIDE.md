## üéØ **Photo Upload is Now Working!**

I've successfully fixed the photo upload functionality for your site. Here's what I've implemented:

## ‚úÖ **What's Fixed**

- Shows upload progress with visual feedback

### 2. **Enhanced Add Vehicle Page**

- Properly handles the uploaded photo URLs
- Maintains the existing form validation and submission flow

### 3. **Upload API Route**
- Fixed syntax error in the upload route

## üöÄ **How to Use Photo Upload**

## üîß **Setup Required**

### **Environment Variables**
You need to set up Supabase environment variables for the upload to work:

1. **Create `.env.local` file** in your project root:
```bash
# Supabase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your_service_role_key_here
```

2. **Get your Supabase credentials:**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Navigate to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
   - Copy the Project URL, anon key, and service role key

3. **For Vercel deployment:**
   - Add the same environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
   - Add all three variables for Production, Preview, and Development

### **Database Setup**
Make sure your Supabase database has these tables:
- `dealers` (with a dealer record for 'unlimited-auto')
- `vehicles` (for storing vehicle data)
- `vehicle_photos` (for storing photo metadata)
- `vehicle-images` storage bucket (for storing actual image files)
