## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core tables with RBAC support
- dealers (multi-tenant)
- users (with role enum)
- vehicles (with assignment)
- leads (with status tracking)
- lead_status_history (audit trail)
- vehicle_photos (with angle codes)
```

### Authentication Flow
1. User enters email on login page
2. Supabase sends magic link
3. User clicks link → authenticated
4. App fetches user profile with role/dealer info
5. RLS policies enforce data access
6. UI renders based on permissions

### Role Hierarchy
```
Level 1: Super Master Admin (SMA) - Platform control
Level 2: Dealer Admin (DA) - Dealer management
Level 3: Sales Manager (SM) - Team management
Level 4: Sales Rep (SR) - Individual work
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Database Setup
Run the updated `supabase-schema.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to create all tables, RLS policies, and sample data.

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure your `.env.local` has:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=your_service_role_key
```

### 3. Create Initial Users
You'll need to create users in Supabase Auth and link them to the `users` table with appropriate roles.

### 4. Test the System
1. Visit `/admin/login`
2. Enter an email address
3. Check email for magic link
4. Click link to authenticate
5. Explore role-based navigation and features
