# Email Setup Guide

## ðŸ“§ **All Leads Now Go to unlimitedautoredford@gmail.com**

I've implemented email notifications for all lead submissions. Here's what you need to do:

### **1. Set Up Resend Email Service**

1. **Sign up at [Resend.com](https://resend.com)**
2. **Get your API key** from the dashboard
3. **Add to your `.env.local` file:**
   ```
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

### **2. Verify Your Domain**

1. **In Resend dashboard**, add and verify your domain `unlimitedauto.com`
2. **This allows emails to be sent from `noreply@unlimitedauto.com`**

### **3. What Gets Emailed**

**All of these now send emails to `unlimitedautoredford@gmail.com`:**

âœ… **Contact Form Submissions**
âœ… **"Get Pre-Approved" Applications** 
âœ… **"Schedule Test Drive" Requests**
âœ… **Credit Applications**
âœ… **General Inquiries**

### **4. Email Content**

Each email includes:
- Customer name, email, phone
- Vehicle interest
- Financial information (income, down payment, credit score)
- Submission timestamp
- Source (which form they used)

### **5. Testing**

Once you set up the API key, test by:
1. Going to your website
2. Filling out any contact form
3. Submitting it
4. Check `unlimitedautoredford@gmail.com` for the notification
